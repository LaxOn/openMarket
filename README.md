*Comment: I implemented a max of 1% of the total loan and $3 instead of a flat $3 for the fee*
 
## Use case:
#### A Lenmo borrower would like to borrower $5,000.00 on paying them back on 6 months period. One of Lenmo investors has offered him 15% Annual Interest Rate. A $3.00 Lenmo fee will be added to the total loan amount to be paid by the investor.  
 
## Requirements:
#### You are required to develop a code using Python language for the following flow;
 
* The borrower submits a loan request including the above loan amount and loan period 
* The investor will submit an offer with the above interest rate
* The borrower will accept the offer
* Check if the investor has sufficient balance in their account before they fund the loan
* The loan will be funded successfully and the loan status will be changed to `Funded` 
* The loan payment will be scheduled successfully on the system
* Once all the payments are successfully paid, the loan status will be `Completed`
